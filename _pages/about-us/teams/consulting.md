_18F Consulting helps federal agencies adopt modern approaches to managing and delivering digital services that save taxpayer dollars and improve the services agencies provide. The team works closely with agency partners to understand both unique and universal needs, provide assessments, make recommendations, and in many cases act on our own recommendations. We transform how agencies understand and execute projects: what to build, how to build, and who will build it._

18F Consulting is a cross-functional team of designers, developers, product strategists, technical and data architects, and acquisition specialists. We have diverse experience inside and outside the federal government. We offer various services including [protosketching](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/06/protosketch/) and design sprints, [agile workshops](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/10/21/how-to-run-your-own-3-sprint-agile-workshop/), [RFP ghostwriting and review services](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/30/new-rfp-ghostwriting-service-to-improve-contract-success/), acquisition services, IT modernization, and vendor marketplace development. Engagements range from four weeks to up to a year.

Our key pieces of documentation include the [Consulting homepage](https://pages.18f.gov/consulting/) and these [Project Briefs for most of our projects](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B497BYqz8M4-fnNZbmN6TGdhN1MtYTZHVjI4d3M0aXVCMkYxdExpTFlCbzVLV0dacVVmVlU).

Joining the Consulting Team
============================

_Welcome to the 18F Consulting team — we’re happy you’re here! We’ve compiled a set of helpful tips to get you started. We’ll update this guide as we receive feedback, so don’t be shy to share your thoughts._

## <a id="checklist">Checklist</a>

[Here’s the list](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Checklists/team-based-checklists/consulting-new-hire-checklist.md) of things to do during your first week on the Consulting team.

Please note that you might not have much assigned work during your first week here. That’s okay and expected. If you’ve gotten all the government onboarding items done and a project _still_ hasn’t landed, the Consulting team has opportunities to shadow projects to get the “lay of the land.” We also have a growing collection of internal projects that aren’t funded but that will help us all work better together. Talk to your Consulting Director (more on that below) to get more information about these internal projects and how you can get involved.


## <a id="who-we-are">Who we are</a>

The Consulting team is a ragtag group of UX geeks, technical /data architects, engagement managers, fintech heads, acquisitions specialists, policy wonks, and in general people passionate about impact at scale. If you got this far, that means we think you'll fit right in. Welcome to your tribe. For more information, see this [full list of skills by staff member](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0i53EqWTzh0l3lrs0us-2bZ_2Z6TUGn2Y3lPHmSuXo/edit#gid=0).

### <a id="vision">Vision</a>

### <a id="mission">Mission</a>

To achieve this vision, we will:

Our internal rules of engagement with each other:

### <a id="structure">Structure</a>

As per [the org chart](/org-chart), 18F Consulting is itself composed of the Engagement Management, Design & Product Strategy, Tech & Data Architecture, and Acquisition Management teams.

The official Director of the Consulting team is Chris Cairns. As the Consulting Team has grown in size, we’ve introduced other leads, called **Consulting Directors**, to facilitate communication. Consulting Directors work both internally with the Consulting team and externally with 18F as a whole to address administrative questions, talk through scope concerns, and coordinate resourcing. In your first week, you’ll be assigned a Consulting Director from your own discipline. 

### <a id="consulting-directors-and-management">Consulting directors and management</a>

- Chris Cairns* — Director, Chief of Consulting
- Jesse Taggert — Consulting Director of Design & Product Strategy
- Shashank Khandelwal — Consulting Director of Tech & Data Architecture
- Dave Zvenyach — Consulting Director of Acquisition Management



## <a id="what-we-do">What we do</a>

The 18F Consulting team helps federal agencies adopt modern approaches to managing and delivering digital services. The team conducts agile training workshops; we provide consulting around things like cloud migration; and we help agencies who are trying to “modernize” and embrace things like user-centered design, agile, etc.

(more on this in the next few weeks)


### <a id="acquisition-management">Acquisition management</a>

In the federal government before 18F, the only way that anything got done was to contract out the work. For the most part, government contracting is a protracted, painful experience for varied reasons.

At its core though, government contracting is just shopping. So imagine that you need to buy a new outfit for a party. You might go to the mall or shop online, pick something that looks nice, and try it on. If you like it, you buy it.

In the federal government you theoretically could do that, but only if the party were two years from now. 18F is trying to reimagine this experience, to make it joyful to procure digital services. Acqstack (acquisitions stack) is our way of doing it, so you can actually buy an outfit in a timely manner, at a reasonable price, and look ​fabulous at the party. (In the words of Dave Zvenyach: "I’ve often joked that I want 18F Consulting to 'be like Etsy, but for Government.'")

## <a id="how-we-work">How we work</a>

We’re a team that’s distributed across the country, so all of our meetings have a video component unless otherwise agreed upon. Also, we subscribe to [the best practices of distributed teams](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/) so redundancy of communication (often on Slack), transparency, and timing for different time zones are built into our planning. We embrace a cross-functional mindset. You’ll often be working with people with wildly different experiences and viewpoints.

### <a id="rituals">Rituals</a>

Most of the Consulting team works on a mix of partner agency projects and internal initiatives. As you’d guess, everyone’s weeks look a little different. That said, there are recurring weekly meetings and commitments we all have on our calendars that are vital for bonding and knowledge sharing. You are encouraged to make these a priority.

- **Tuesdays:** 18F All-Hands meeting, 12:30 p.m. ET (9:30 a.m. PT).
- **Fridays:** 18F Consulting-specific staff meeting. 2:30 pm ET (11:30 am PST). This meeting consists of sharing lessons learned from projects, evolving strategies, leadership updates, and a space to talk talk about what’s working and what’s not.

### <a id="communication-channels">Communication channels</a>

- Slack channels: [#18f-consulting](https://18f.slack.com/messages/18f-consulting) is our main channel with separate channels for projects (consulting projects begin with the prefix `c-`)
- Mailing lists: 18FC@gsa.gov
