18F Engineering is responsible for delivering high quality, robust, open source software. We also evangelize best practices relating to software testing, scalability, operations, security, and agile development.

Collectively, we’re experienced in a wide variety of technologies including Python, Ruby, server and client-side JavaScript, Go, C, relational and schema-less databases, ETL pipelines, version control, testing frameworks, machine learning, and more. See the skill tags for [everyone in Float](https://18f.float.com/people).

### Documentation

Our [Engineering Best Practices guide](https://pages.18f.gov/development-guide/) has details about Git, code reviews, and more. You might also enjoy the [open source](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/open-source/) archives on the blog.

# Joining the Engineering team

Welcome to the 18F Engineering team — we’re happy you’re here! We’ve compiled tips to help you get started. We’ll update this guide as we receive feedback, so don’t be shy to share your thoughts.

## <a id="checklist">Checklist</a>

Follow the [Engineering checklist](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Checklists/team-based-checklists/dev-new-hire-checklist.md) during your first week. 

Please note that you might not have much assigned work during your first few weeks here. That’s okay and expected. If you’ve gotten all the government onboarding items done and a project _still_ hasn’t landed, the Engineering team has a long list of internal projects that aren’t funded but that will help us work better together. Talk to your faciltator (more on that below) to learn more.


## Who we are

Members of the Engineering team come from all over: major technology companies, startups, civic nonprofits, other parts of government, and news outlets. Collectively, we’re experienced in a wide variety of technologies. You'll probably be able to find someone to help you with whatever question you have.

### Structure

As per [the org chart](/org-chart), 18F Engineering is itself composed of smaller, “engineering teams,” each organized by a **facilitator.** While most engineers at 18F work in cross-functional _project_ teams, the facilitator engineering teams serve as small communities of practice to encourage cross-pollination that might not otherwise occur in a large, distributed team. 

Teams occasionally meet to:

- Workshop tech talks (in preparation for a wider team talk or speaking engagement)
- Demo projects
- Collaboratively solve architecture/programming problems
- Improve 18F’s hiring (group resume review, interview practice)
- Engage in discussions and feedback sessions
- Introduce members to one another! 

[These activities](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1_NKx-zMwYqBqV48k062j4X2zdhKdYUgYlnM3wMpn5p8/edit) are largely meant to increase cohesion across Engineering.

### Facilitators

Team facilitators help create, maintain, and grow the positive and collaborative culture of 18F Engineering, especially as we experience sustained growth. Their responsibilities include:

- Assist the Engineering Director in onboarding new members to the team
- Conduct regular 1:1 meetings with the members of their teams
- Conduct regular [team meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NKx-zMwYqBqV48k062j4X2zdhKdYUgYlnM3wMpn5p8/edit)
- Work with members of their teams to create/update their OKRs/goals documents
- Conduct performance reviews in conjunction with the Engineering Director, including:
  - Summarize peer feedback
  - Discuss the individual’s self review
  - Evaluate the individual’s progress on their OKRs/goals
- Be available to members of their teams to discuss and give feedback on goals/OKRs
- Flag developing concerns or issues with the team to the Engineering Director
- Assist the Engineering Director with project staffing decisions
- Attend regular facilitator group meetings
- Pass individual/aggregate feedback from the facilitator teams to the Engineering Director

Facilitators are selected through nominations and interviews according to team needs. While there is no additional compensation for being a facilitator, it’s an opportunity to help make team members’ time at 18F great. [The facilitator checklist](https://github.com/18F/onboarding-documents/blob/master/Checklists/engineering-facilitator-checklist.md) is useful for facilitators who have a new employee coming on board their team.

### Functional Leads

Engineering also has five functional leads: backend, frontend, operations, security, and diversity. Collectively and separately they work to make our engineering practice better by improving documenation, project oversight, training, hiring, onboarding, and making us a diverse and inclusive organization.

## FAQ

### What is expected of me regarding time tracking and how I spend my time?

18F team members are committed to up to 32 hours weekly of project time. Your remaining time is intended for general meetings, like the weekly all hands, and working group or guild participation. If you don’t have enough project work to fill 32 hours, please let your facilitator know.

All 18F staff track their time in [Tock](https://tock.18f.gov/). Time sheets for the previous week are due at the end of the day (COB in your time zone) each Monday. Learn more in the [Tock guide](/tock/).

While cost recovery is an important organizational goal, internal, non-billable work is important as well. Engineers needn't worry about how many billable hours they work, but rather how many project hours. 

### I’m interested in working on a different or additional project. How can I do that?

Your facilitator is responsible for making sure you have the right amount and kind of project work. However, you're encouraged to get involved in finding projects you're interested in. To do this:

- Review projects in the [staffing-and-resources repository](https://github.com/18F/staffing-and-resources/issues). The issue threads will have lots of extraneous information, but look for issues tagged with the Engineering chapter. If you find a project you're interested in, comment on the issue or talk to your facilitator.
- Look out for Project Q&A invites in your inbox and on the 18F Events calendar. These sessions get together product/engagement leads from projects in need of engineers. They will give you some information on the project and a chance to ask questions.
- Watch the #eng-projects channel in Slack. 
- Talk to your facilitator. 

### How can I become an interviewer or resume reviewer?

Thanks for wanting to participate in hiring! In order to review resumes, GSA requires that you be a Subject Matter Expert (SME), which involves a small amount of training. You don't need to be a SME to be an interviewer. 

To do either or both, please get in touch with [Esther Chang](https://18f.slack.com/team/esther).

### How can I participate in a technical evaluation for projects in intake?

Tech eval requests are posted in the [staffing-and-resources repository](https://github.com/18F/staffing-and-resources/issues). Look for any tagged with the Engineering chapter. Comment on the issue to express your interest.

### I have an idea for a project we should pursue. How do I make it a reality?

You’re  encouraged to identify areas where government can be made better and participate in identifying agency partners.

- There is a monthly Great Pitch that OCSIT/18F hold that awards seed funding to projects. Watch out for emails about these, and see the [pitch application template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEoc8h9uaVXtwYgLj0YiQleXbr6dmj0OA3NDO0cAtWM/edit).
- [#seeds](https://18f.slack.com/archives/seeds) can help you find out what funding options are available if Great Pitch isn't a good match.

## <a id="rituals">Rituals</a>

Most of the Engineering team works on a mix of partner agency projects and internal initiatives. As you’d guess, everyone’s weeks look a little different. That said, there are recurring weekly meetings and commitments we all have on our calendars.

- **Monthly tech talks.** See the 18F Events Calendar or [sign up for a talk](https://github.com/18F/tech-talks/blob/master/Queue.md).
- **Once a week (ideally): meet with your facilitator.** Once a week or less frequently, depending on your preference, you’ll have a short check-in with your facilitator at a time that’s convenient for both of you.
- **Once a week (ideally): meet with your Engineering team.** Once a week, you’ll meet with your (roughly) eight-person team to conduct [various activities](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1_NKx-zMwYqBqV48k062j4X2zdhKdYUgYlnM3wMpn5p8/edit) designed to bring your team together and share knowledge.
