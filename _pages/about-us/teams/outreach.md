title: Outreach
---

The Outreach team is responsible for promoting the work of digital innovators at 18F and across government. Our work spans a number of media outlets, including [the content of 18F’s public-facing website](https://18f.gsa.gov/), [our blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/), our external and internal newsletters, our Twitter feed ([@18F](https://twitter.com/18F)), responses to press, and responses to emails to [18f@gsa.gov](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

The Outreach team is situated in the Learn Business Unit, and its members wear many hats regarding evangelism, education, and outreach. The Outreach team facilitates both internal (for example, editing policies and memos) and external (for example, our blog, press engagements, or social media) communications needs. We want to help you tell 18F’s stories, and we’re excited to have you all on board and contributing to all of our communications! Don’t hesitate to call on the Outreach team to help with your comms needs.

Are you speaking at an event? Ping us in [#outreach](https://18f.slack.com/archives/outreach) so we can provide you with team talking points, take a look at your presentation, and help you promote the event.

## Project announcements

If you're a project manager or storyteller working on an 18F project, make sure you create a communications plan. [A template and comms plans for other 18F projects are in Google Drive](https://goo.gl/2VMKe9)

## Blog
Outreach is responsible for running the [18F blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/news). We use our blog to write about how we work, the culture of 18F, progress on our delivery and consulting projects, and to educate digital workers in the federal government about important topics. We also use our blog to highlight good work being done by other federal agencies and as a recruiting tool for 18F. 
The primary contacts for the blog are Andre Francisco and Greg Boone. Blog business is conducted in [#blog](https://18f.slack.com/archives/blog) and as &ldquo;issues&rdquo; attached to the [blog-drafts repository](https://github.com/18F/blog-drafts/issues) on GitHub.

Everyone at 18F is encouraged to write for the blog; you don’t have to be some kind of veteran to speak on our behalf. Check out the [18F Blogging Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/blogging-guide/), which lays out the process more formally, and can tell you more about our mission and process. We're happy to meet you wherever you are in the writing process.

To get started, join [#blog](https://18f.slack.com/archives/blog), [attend our weekly blog meeting](#blog-meeting), or [file an issue in the `blog-drafts` repo](https://github.com/18F/blog-drafts/issues). There are also a ton of issues in the [`idea` milestone container](https://github.com/18F/blog-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Aidea) in `blog-drafts`. If you want to write something and you’re not sure what to write about, start there.

After you decide what you want to write about, your post can go in a few directions: a short update, a formal product launch, an educational series, a video, a Q&amp;A session, a &ldquo;a day in the life&rdquo; post, etc. Blog posts don’t have to be long &mdash; 300 words is plenty. Finally, if you have something you’d like on the blog but writing isn’t your strong suit (or you don’t have the time), reach out in [#blog](https://18f.slack.com/archives/blog) and we can arrange for someone to interview you and write the post for you!

Everyone should have access to the [18F Blog Editorial Calendar on Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render??tab=mc&pli=1#details_2%7Cdtv-Z3NhLmdvdl9wa2tiZjUzdTFtNmlzOWdpNzZ2MWw4aTVqOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t-0-0). The blog team uses this to forecast when blog posts will be published. We can’t publish whenever we want, since the GSA and partner-agency approval process can take weeks. It’s best to start discussing a blog post as soon as you can.

### <a name="blog-meeting"></a>Weekly blog meeting
Outreach has a weekly blog huddle at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesdays where the team goes over the calendar for the week. Ask for the room number or video call link in [#blog](https://18f.slack.com/archives/blog). Anyone is free to drop in for as little or as long as they would like to workshop ideas or just bounce a thought off the group.

## Newsletter

The 18F newsletter goes out every two weeks to more than 6,000 people. Our subscribers are a mix of government and the public, but everything in the newsletter is meant for public consumption. The goal of the newsletter is to highlight posts from our blog, let people know about civic tech events, and (very importantly) shine a light on the awesome work of our federal colleagues.

You should [sign up for the newsletter](https://18f.gsa.gov/#newsletter).

Like our blog, the newsletter is always in need of submissions &mdash; especially of cool things other people are doing. Please send any interesting projects or initiatives you see over to [#newsletter](https://18f.slack.com/archives/newsletter). Did some city adopt our design standards? Did an agency release a new data set? Is there a civic hackathon happening somewhere? We want to hear about it.

### Internal newsletter

18F also has an internal newsletter to keep you informed about what everyone is doing (18F org business, and more inside-baseball type of info). To learn more, hop into [#newsletter](https://18f.slack.com/archives/newsletter).
