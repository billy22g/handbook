title: Acano
---

Acano is video-conferencing software that makes it easy to see all of our coworkers during large meetings.

## Setup

Acano runs in any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox). Many of us use the [Mac desktop client](https://clientupgrade.acano.com/download/oBklj0sd28dl2mz/AcanoClient.dmg), and there's also an [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/acano/id680581809?mt=8) if you want to meet from your iPhone.

## Rules

**Abide by [the 18F Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).** If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, please contact [Noah Kunin](https://18f.slack.com/messages/noah/) or [Hillary Hartley](https://18f.slack.com/messages/hillary/).

## Usage

- **Many people at 18F prefer the desktop-based app to the browser version.** To force use of the desktop app, open the Acano meeting link in Firefox or Safari, not Chrome. Opening in those browsers will allow you to go to the app as a guest (without needing an Acano user account). In Firefox, the app will launch after you enter the name and passcode.

- **Please mute yourself if you're not speaking.** The mute button appears in the top middle of the meeting window. Alternatively, you can install Steven Reilly's [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/videochat-auto-mute/hbnakdpkiaeifdfkpipkcnmojleiklme) to auto-mute Acano and when you open it and unmute with the spacebar.

- **Please don't use Acano's text-based chat,** as most participants can't see it and the chat-log remains in the room for the next users to see (if you're using a shared coSpace). Instead, use a Slack channel. We use [#general-talk](https://18f.slack.com/messages/general-talk) for [all-hands meetings](/meetings-and-meeting-tools#all-hands).

## Tips

- **You can turn off your camera** by clicking the camera icon next to your image in the client.
- **You can switch between Speaker Large and "Brady Bunch" view** in settings (the ellipsis icon in the top right of the meeting window).
- **You don't need an account to use Acano.** Many of us join Acano as a guest, or reserve a shared coSpace (a "digital conference room"). Have questions or need help? Ask in the [#admins-acano](https://18f.slack.com/messages/admins-acano/) channel in Slack.
- **To figure out who is talking** on a call, click on the person icon on the right hand corner. This shows who is in the call. When someone is speaking you will see an icon next to their name.
- **Trouble hearing?** Try adjusting your microphone volume in system preferences.
- **What to do if you're in a room and the mics are out of power or don't work:** You can use the telephone in the room to dial the conference line associated with the Acano room. However, you should first turn down the audio coming into the room by turning the Codec Volume all the way down. It's located in the bottom right of the Video TeleConference (VTC) control unit.
- **One weird trick for DC rooms:** In D.C., the vents by the windows make a noticeable and distracting whirring sound. You can make it stop by cracking the window open by one or two inches.

## Join an Acano meeting from the Chicago office

Confirm via the Google Calendar that room 3380 is booked for the meeting. Please book the room starting ten minutes before the meeting is scheduled to begin. In 3380, the Acano console is on the table and [looks like this](/images/acano/8.png). Press the **Video Conference** button on the left side at the scheduled start time, and Acano should do the rest.

## Running meetings

### Acano-friendly rooms

3. Change your password.
4. Set up the security questions you'll need to reset your password.
5. Download the desktop client if you haven't already.
6. Login with `first.last@mycospace.com` and your new password.

## Reset your password

3. Name your coSpace and, optionally, give it a password.


## Use Acano with a Video TeleConference (VTC) unit

You will need an [Acano account](#get-an-acano-account) or have access to someone else's Acano account to do this.

### Find the SIP address

1. Turn on the VTC in the room from the handset, often under **Home > Video Conference**.
2. Go to the VTC settings (often **OK/Menu > Settings > System Information**).
3. There, you should see a SIP address in the form of `######@gsa.gov` (for example, room 5143 is 131025@gsa.gov).
4. Navigate to **Settings > System Information**.

### When planning the meeting

1. Choose an Acano-friendly room.
2. Reserve an Acano coSpace. Be sure to include the start time and stop time (with time zone) as well as your name. Note that Acano can take up to ten minutes to set up, so be sure to include lead time when reserving your conference room.
3. Share the dial-in information for your coSpace with your attendees.
4. Note the SIP address (for example, SIP:131024@gsa.gov) for the conference room, as you'll need it to start your Acano session.

### 10 minutes before the meeting

1. Turn on the VTC unit by pressing the screen of the wall control unit  <img src="/images/acano/1.jpg" alt="Acano wall unit at GSA">    
2. Choose the **video conference** option.
3. Place the wireless microphones on the table. They&rsquo;re usually charging in one of the cabinets. Check to make sure the mics&rsquo; lights blink only green when you press the button. If they flash red and green, the mic is not charged.
4. In Safari, navigate to your reserved coSpace.
5. Safari should ask you if you&rsquo;d like to open in the Acano application. Click **Yes**.
6. When the Acano application opens, click **Connect device**.
7. Select **Single screen** and enter the SIP address, for example, SIP:131024@gsa.gov.
8. Click **Connect**.
9. The VTC unit will announce an incoming call. Accept it by pressing the **OK/Menu** button.
10. When you&rsquo;re done, press **End Call**. Otherwise, the conference room stays connected. We’ve had calls going for days because they were not properly disconnected.

## Run an all-hands meeting

1. Find the connection information in the calendar invite.
1. Make sure you have an [Acano account](#get-an-acano-account).
2. A few days before the meeting, ask [Leah Gitter](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@leahgitter) to add you to the All-Hands Cospace. This will give you administrator access to the virtual room.
3. Launch the Acano app and log in.
4. Click **coSpaces** and choose **Tuesday All-Hands**.
5. Click the **Join Call** button in the top right.
