We use Gmail for email.

## Usage

You can access your email from <https://mail.google.com> or <https://mail.gsa.gov>.

## Rules

**Abide by [the 18F Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).** If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, please contact [Noah Kunin](https://18f.slack.com/messages/noah/) or [Hillary Hartley](https://18f.slack.com/messages/hillary/).

## Tips

- **If you go by a different name, create an alias.** You can create an alias to have a different email address, like if you go by something other than your legal name.

- **Create filters.** You can create filters to manage the influx of automatic emails you’ll be receiving (like Region X Communications). You can select "add a label" and automatically “archive" or put messages into different folders.

- **You can set your photo** for your Google profile in [Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/35529?hl=en).
