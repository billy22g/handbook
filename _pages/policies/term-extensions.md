This guide covers how to extend your time at 18F after two years.

## Background

Most employees at 18F are hired on term appointments under the Schedule A direct hiring authority, which sets a limit of two years for the initial period of employment with the option to renew for up to two additional years for a maximum term of four years.

## Renew your term

Connect with your supervisors six months before your initial two-year term expires to discuss your options. Considerations for renewal include organizational priorities, position needs, and your individual performance to date (for example, have you consistently received a 3 or higher appraisal).

Once you and your supervisor mutually agree that it is or is not in 18F's best interest to renew your engagement, your supervisor should alert the Talent Team.

If the decision is to renew, the Talent Team will process a Request for Personnel Action (RPA) to extend your term. Please note that you do not have to renew for the full two years; you could renew for less time (such as 1 year, 6 months, or 1 month). Your employment status and benefits will remain the same and no additional action is needed from you or your supervisor.

If the decision is not to renew, the Talent Team will process an RPA to end your term at the end of the initial two years. See [Leaving 18F](https://handbook.18f.gov/leaving-18f) for more details.
