First thing that you’ll need is a “travel vendor ID” via email.

1. Fill out [the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing). _Yes, you probably already did it at orientation, so this seems repetitive. However, there is a good reason for it. [Click here to find out why](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHGnvUVGzYJkSuW0-2ZEy4g4vwgNLLkZcI1j5JVozDQ/edit#bookmark=id.f206jlg5swxh)._

2.  [Click here](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&ui=2&tf=0&fs=1&to=kc-vendor.number.requests%40gsa.gov&su=Request%20to%20Obtain%20Employee%20ID&body=To%20KC%20Vendor%2C%0A%0ACould%20I%20please%20have%20my%20employee%20ID%3F%0A%0AThank%20you%2C%0A) to start a pre-populated email.

3. Attach the EFT Form to this email & send.

4. Wait for a reply to this email.
You’ll get a number like **E000xxxxx** in the reply, which is important for the next step. _While you wait, you might want to get a start on [getting a travel card](/first-time-travel-travel-card)_.

5. Fill out [CGE Access Request Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_EbM3ZRaHRqRHFWSzA/view?usp=sharing) (minus the EFT enrollment form that you already did on page 3).
Either an electronic or ink signature is fine.

6. Get your supervisor's signature on that form. _ What are Correspondence/Office Symbols?_ Check your email signature.

7. Email completed CGE form to ethan.heppner@gsa.gov
