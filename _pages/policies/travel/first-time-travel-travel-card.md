A GSA Travel card will help you pay for lodging, taxis and other miscellaneous expenses while on your trip.

While new employees may travel without one, it is required that everyone at 18F has one as soon as possible.

### 1. Complete Card Training

You will need your Employee ID obtained in Step 1.

_Est. time: 45 minutes_

1. Click on Create New Account.
2. Use your GSA email as the username and create any password.
3. Take the training (~20 pages of info followed by a quiz).
4. Save your certificate of completion as “Your Name TCTC”

### 2. Fill out the Supervisory Travel Card Approval

_Estimated time: 10 minutes plus wait time for your supervisor’s signature_

1. Download the [Supervisory Travel Card Approval Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_EbN2ZHRFVSZkRZeVU/view) and fill out the following fields.

  * **Employee name:** Your name
  * **Region/Central Office:** Central Office, regardless of your actual location
  * **SSO:** X - Office of Citizen Services & Innovative Technologies
  * **Supervisor name:** The name of your functional supervisor
  * **Supervisor title:** Your functional supervisor’s title
  * **Supervisor signature:** Your functional supervisor’s signature.

2. Save the doc as “Your Name STCAF”

### 3. Send both of the above docs as attachments to [18f-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-travel@gsa.gov).

### 4. Wait to hear from Karen Asthon via email.

This may take 1-2 business days.

1. Once you’ve gotten the go-ahead from Karen, start the Citibank Online Travel Card application
 [here](https://home.cards.citidirect.com/CommercialCard/Cards.html?classic=2). [_Having Trouble?_](#having-trouble)

2. For the application, you’ll be asked for a GSA phone number of record. It sounds counterintuitive, but **if you do not have a government-issued phone, you can use the last four digits of your social security number.** Otherwise, use your GSA phone number.

3. You’ll also need to provide a Region of Record. Put in **00** (Central Office).

4. Email karen.ashton@gsa.gov and c.c. 18f-travel@gsa.gov to ensure that it gets processed!

### 5. Receive your card in the mail

* Wait 7-10 business days for processing and shipping.
* You will receive Travel Card in the mail at your listed address (should be your home address).

### 6. Activate your card.
